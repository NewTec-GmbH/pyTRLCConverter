pyTRLCConverter is a command-line tool to convert TRLC files to different output formats. Since the definition of TRLC types is project-specific, the built-in converters can be extended in an object-oriented manner.

Currently out of the box supported formats:

* Markdown
* docx
* reStructuredText
* dump

Find the requirements, test cases, coverage and etc. on the [github pages](https://newtec-gmbh.github.io/pyTRLCConverter/).

Find the requirements, test cases, coverage and etc. deployed on [github pages](https://newtec-gmbh.github.io/pyTRLCConverter).

## Installation

Follow these steps to setup an editable pyTRLCConverter workspace using a virtual python environment.

### Clone this Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NewTec-GmbH/pyTRLCConverter.git
cd pyTRLCConverter
```

### Setup a virtual Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 # <- Windows Power Shell version
```

Note:

- For Windows CMD shell, use ```.venv\Scripts\activate.bat``` to activate the virtual environment.
- For Linux/Macos, use ```source .venv/bin/activate``` to activate the virtual environment.

### Tool Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Conversion to Markdown format

The tool requires two kinds of TRLC input sources for the conversion. These are the requirements (\*.trlc) files and the model (\*.tls) files. These input files are specified using one or more --source  or -s options followed by a file name or directory path. If a path is given, all files with a .trlc or .tls extension are read by the tool.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter --source trlc/model --source trlc/swe-req markdown
```

It will create a Markdown file with the same name as the requirements file (\*.trlc) in the current directory, but with the Markdown extension (.md).

If the requirements are split into several files, a Markdown file will be created for each. To generate a single Markdown file the argument --single-document can be used, which will create an ```output.md``` file by default.

The converter supports additional arguments that are shown by adding the --help option after the markdown subcommand.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter markdown --help

usage: pyTRLCConverter markdown [-h] [-n NAME] [-sd] [-tl TOP_LEVEL]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Name of the generated output file inside the output folder (default = output.md) in case a single document is generated.
  -sd, --single-document
                        Generate a single document instead of multiple files. The default is to generate multiple files.
  -tl TOP_LEVEL, --top-level TOP_LEVEL
                        Name of the top level heading, required in single document mode. (default = Specification)
```

More examples are shown in the [examples folder](./examples/).

### Conversion to docx format

Similar to the Markdown conversion, minimal required are the requirements (\*.trlc) and the model (\*.tls). Both can be added by file name or just the path where they are located.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter --source trlc/model --source trlc/swe-req docx
```

It will create a docx file with default name ```output.docx``` in the current directory.

If the requirements are split in several files, they will be all part of a single docx file.

The converter supports additional arguments that are shown by adding the --help option after the docx subcommand.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter docx --help

usage: pyTRLCConverter docx [-h] [-t TEMPLATE] [-n NAME]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                        Load the given docx file as a template to append to.
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Name of the generated output file inside the output folder (default = output.docx).
```

### Conversion to reStructuredText format

The tool requires two kinds of TRLC input sources for the conversion. These are the requirements (\*.trlc) files and the model (\*.tls) files. These input files are specified using one or more --source  or -s options followed by a file name or directory path. If a path is given, all files with a .trlc or .tls extension are read by the tool.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter --source trlc/model --source trlc/swe-req rst
```

If the requirements are split into several files (\*.trlc), a reStructuredText file will be created for each. To generate a single reStructuredText file the argument --single-document can be used, which will create an ```output.md``` file by default.

The converter supports additional arguments that are shown by adding the --help option after the reStructuredText subcommand.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter rst --help

usage: pyTRLCConverter rst [-h] [-e EMPTY] [-n NAME] [-sd] [-tl TOP_LEVEL]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EMPTY, --empty EMPTY
                        Every attribute value which is empty will output the string (default = N/A).
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Name of the generated output file inside the output folder (default = output.rst) in case a single document is generated.
  -sd, --single-document
                        Generate a single document instead of multiple files. The default is to generate multiple files.
  -tl TOP_LEVEL, --top-level TOP_LEVEL
                        Name of the top level heading, required in single document mode (default = Specification).
```

More examples are shown in the [examples folder](./examples/).

### Dump TRLC item list to console

Mainly for development all TRLC items can be dumped to the console.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter --source trlc/model --source trlc/swe-req dump
```

### Use an attribute name translation

The built-in converters display the requirements and their attributes in a table. The first column always contains the attribute name, and the second column contains the attribute value. Since the attribute names must comply with the TRLC standard, they are not always human-readable.

Therefore a translation JSON file can be used to translate the attribute names. Use the ```--translation``` argument to specify the translation file.

Translation file example:

```json
{
    "SwRequirement": {
        "desc": "Description"
    }
}
```

See the [example](./examples/simple_req_translation/) for more information.

### Show tool version

Show the version of the tool to see whether the required one is used.

```bash
pyTRLCConverter --help
```

### PlantUML

With the PlantUML extension the tool supports the automatic diagram generation out of a PlantUML file.

Activate the support by adding the path to the java jar file to the ```PLANTUML``` environment variable.

## Examples

Check out the all the [Examples](./examples).

## Compile into an executable

It is possible to create an executable file that contains the tool and all its dependencies. "PyInstaller" is used for this.
Just run the following command on the root of the folder:

```cmd
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --console --name "pyTRLCConverter" --add-data "./pyproject.toml;."  "./src/pyTRLCConverter/__main__.py"
```

## SW Documentation

More information on the deployment and architecture can be found in the [documentation](./doc/README.md)

For Detailed Software Design run `$ /doc/detailed-design/make html` to generate the detailed design documentation that then can be found
in the folder `/doc/detailed-design/_build/html/index.html`
