```

## SW Documentation

More information on the deployment and architecture can be found in the [documentation](./doc/README.md)

For Detailed Software Design run `$ /doc/detailed-design/make html` to generate the detailed design documentation that then can be found
in the folder `/doc/detailed-design/_build/html/index.html`
